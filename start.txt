To start, anaroot should be installed and sourced. To check if anaroot is sourced correctly, try:
echo $TARTSYS
Or use the bash script:
./setup_dir.sh 
which automatically checks for the variable and creates the link needed.

The additional setup step that must be done manually is to set the ridf location, using a soft link:
ln -sf /RIDF/FOLDER/LOCATION ridf

The macros in this repository will expect structure: ridf/SMDAQ####.ridf
